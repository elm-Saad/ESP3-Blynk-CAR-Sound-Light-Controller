✅ Correct workflow

1. Prepare WAV file
  -> 8-bit PCM
  -> 22050 Hz

2. Open the page

3. In the select bar → choose the name you want (ex: indicator)

3. Upload the WAV file

5. You get a .h file like:

unsigned char PROGMEM indicatorSamples[40923] = {
  0x52, 0x49, 0x46, 0x46, ...
};
